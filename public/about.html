    <h3>Personal</h3>
    <p>I love music, videogames, science fiction, horror movies and a bunch of other stuff, but let's break it down a little bit. <br/>
        Music has always been an important part of my life. Since I was a kid, I've always been interested in music. I play a little bit of guitar and
        bass, I also sing. I consider to have an extensive range of music taste, here are some of the genres I like the most:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Indie</li>
        <li>Metalcore</li>
        <li>Rap/Hip Hop</li>
        <li>Mathcore</li>
        <li>Alternative Rock</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With that I can assure you I could probably know the band you like the most, or at least I could hear of it sometime.
        Here are some of my most listened bands:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Movements</li>
        <li>Make them suffer</li>
        <li>Tyler, the creator</li>
        <li>Sharif</li>
        <li>Bring me the horizon</li>
        <li>Paramore</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <!-- Videogames -->
    <p>With music comes the videogames, I'm a Nintendo & Playstation guy. The legend of Zelda and God of war are the best sagas, ever.
        I also love fighting games like Street Fighter, Tekken (I'm really bad at it), Mortal Kombat or Smash Bross.
    </p>
